# Make a set of classes and methods to implement linear algebra operations
I will try to build a library that allows me to do linear algebra operations
(basically like numpy). I will attempt to implement all the steps covered in
Gilbert Strang's Introduction to linear algebra. I will only use python's built
in objects and methods.

## Needed classes

### Vector (1d matrices)
#### Methods
- Addition/Subtraction
- Multiplication 
u' * u = dot product
u * u' = n by n matrix
- Transpose

### Matrices (built from vectors)
#### Methods
EA = U
A = LU
A = QR
Rank
Pivot Columns
Inverse
Four fundamental subspaces
Bases for fundamental subspaces
Determinant

## Standalone functions
- Projection
- Orthogonalisation
- Orthonormal basis

### Visualisation
- Projection
- Transformation
